# VIGL STRATEGY EXIT PROTOCOL
## When to Hold vs When to Fold

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM

Holding for +100% is great... until the stock drops -40% and you give back all gains.

**Need:** Early warning system to exit BEFORE major damage.

---

## 🚨 EXIT TRIGGERS (In Priority Order)

### 1. HARD STOP (Never Violate)
**-15% from entry price**
- Cut immediately, no exceptions
- Preserves capital for next trade
- **Applies to:** All positions, regardless of thesis

### 2. TRAILING STOP (Protects Gains)
**-15% from highest price reached**
- Example: Buy at $10, runs to $20, stop at $17 (15% below $20)
- Lets winners run, protects profits
- **Applies to:** All positions in profit

### 3. MOMENTUM BREAKDOWN (Early Warning)
**Technical signals:**
- Closes below 20-day EMA for 2+ days
- Volume dries up on rallies (no buying interest)
- Lower highs + lower lows pattern
- Breaks key support level

**Action:** Scale out 50% immediately, trail remaining 50% tightly (-10%)

### 4. TIME STOP (Opportunity Cost)
**Position flat for 10+ trading days**
- No momentum = dead money
- Exit and redeploy capital
- **Exception:** If still above entry, hold with tight trail

### 5. PROFIT PROTECTION (Already Up Big)
**Position up +50%+, then drops -20% from peak**
- Example: Runs to $15 (+50%), drops to $12 (-20% from peak)
- Scale out 50% immediately
- Trail remaining 50% at -10%

## 🛡️ THE PROTECTION RULES

1. **Never let winner turn to loser**
   - Once up +20%, stop moves to breakeven
   - Once up +50%, trail at -15%

2. **Cut losers fast, let winners run**
   - -15% stop is absolute
   - Winners can run to +300%+

3. **Scale out on weakness, not strength**
   - Don't sell because it's up
   - Sell because momentum is breaking

4. **Time is money**
   - Flat for 10 days = opportunity cost
   - Exit and find next VIGL

---

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

**Good Exit:**
- Sold on trailing stop at +80% (missed +100%, but protected +65%)
- Cut at -12% before -30% drop
- Scaled at +45% on momentum break (avoided -25% drawdown)

**Bad Exit:**
- Sold at +25% because "it was up" (missed +200%)
- Held through -40% drop (violated trailing stop)
- Exited flat after 15 days (impatient, then it ran +150%)

---

## 🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE

**VIGL Strategy = Asymmetric Risk/Reward**

- **Upside:** Unlimited (+100%, +300%, +500%)
- **Downside:** Capped at -15% (hard stop) or -15% trail

**We can afford to be wrong 50% of the time if winners pay 10:1.**

**Example:**
- 10 trades: 5 losers (-15% each = -75%), 5 winners (+100% avg = +500%)
- Net: +425% return

**That's the VIGL math.**
