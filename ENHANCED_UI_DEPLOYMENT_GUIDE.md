cp backend/src/services/learning_integration.py production_backend/src/services/learning_integration.py
cp backend/src/services/learning_database.py production_backend/src/services/learning_database.py

# Initialize learning database
curl -X POST "https://amc-trader.onrender.com/learning/init-database"
```

### Step 2: Deploy Enhanced Frontend Components

The UI components are ready for deployment to `https://amc-frontend.onrender.com`:

```bash
# Copy enhanced components to frontend
cp frontend/src/components/EnhancedLearningDashboard.tsx production_frontend/src/components/
cp frontend/src/components/InteractiveTradeTracker.tsx production_frontend/src/components/
cp frontend/src/components/UpdatesPage.tsx production_frontend/src/components/

# Build and deploy frontend
cd production_frontend
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Step 3: Validate Deployment

```bash
# Run deployment validation
python3 test_enhanced_ui.py

# Expected result: 100% readiness after full deployment
```
