# Critical Bug Fixed - February 8, 2026

## The Problem

All OpenClaw daily automation jobs were configured to run **MONDAY ONLY**, not Monday-Friday as documented.

**Impact:** The stock investment system would only run on Mondays. Tuesday-Friday had NO automated checks, scanners, or portfolio reviews.

## Root Cause

In the launchd .plist files, each job had a single `StartCalendarInterval` with:
```xml
<key>Weekday</key>
<integer>1</integer>  <!-- Monday only -->
```

macOS launchd interprets this as "run ONLY on Monday", not "run on weekdays starting from Monday".

## The Fix

Updated all 6 daily automation .plist files to include 5 separate `StartCalendarInterval` entries (one for each weekday):

**Files Fixed:**
1. `com.openclaw.morning_briefing.plist` - 6:00 AM Mon-Fri
2. `com.openclaw.premarket_scanner.plist` - 6:30 AM Mon-Fri
3. `com.openclaw.market_open.plist` - 6:31 AM Mon-Fri
4. `com.openclaw.midday_check.plist` - 9:00 AM Mon-Fri
5. `com.openclaw.power_hour.plist` - 12:00 PM Mon-Fri
6. `com.openclaw.market_close.plist` - 1:00 PM Mon-Fri

**Note:** `com.openclaw.weekly_learning.plist` was already correct (Friday only).

## Verification

✅ All jobs reloaded in launchd
✅ Verified all jobs loaded: `launchctl list | grep openclaw`
✅ Test run successful: Morning briefing script executed correctly
✅ Current portfolio data retrieved from Alpaca API
