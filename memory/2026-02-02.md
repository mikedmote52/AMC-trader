# 2026-02-02 - Model Migration Complete

## What Happened
- Successfully migrated primary AI model from Sonnet 4.5 to Kimmy K2.5 (moonshotai/kimi-k2.5) via OpenRouter
- Added DeepSeek V3.2 as secondary model for future use
- Set Sonnet as fallback if Kimmy K fails
- Kept Haiku for heartbeats (already saving ~$54/month)

## Cost Impact
- **Before**: Sonnet primary (~$2-3/day) + Sonnet heartbeat (~$2/day) = ~$4-5/day
- **After**: Kimmy K primary (~$0.30-0.50/day) + Haiku heartbeat (~$0.20/day) = ~$0.50-0.70/day
- **Savings**: ~$3.50-4.30/day (~75-85% reduction)

## Config Changes
- Primary: `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` (alias: kimi)
- Fallback: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` (alias: sonnet)  
- Heartbeat: `anthropic/claude-haiku-4` (alias: haiku)
- Secondary: `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v3.2` (alias: deepseek)
- API key stored in: `~/.openclaw/secrets/openrouter.json`

## Testing Plan
- Use tonight to verify Kimmy K handles trading analysis well
- Monitor for any quality issues vs Sonnet
- Can rollback instantly by switching primary back to sonnet

## Context
User traveling tomorrow (2026-02-03) - needed cheaper model to extend $63 API budget for 2-week trip. Target was 54% cost reduction, achieved ~75%.
