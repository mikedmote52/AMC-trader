- **Today's P&L:** +$156 (+0.15%)
- **Positions:** 19 stocks

## Scanner Test - Day 1
Launched diamond_scanner_v2 and bought first picks to validate:
- **CFLT:** -0.3% (entry $30.45 → close $30.35) - Score: 105/170
- **KRE:** +0.5% (entry $70.81 → close $71.20) - Score: 95/170

Verdict: Inconclusive first day. Need more time to validate.

## Systems Built Today
1. ✅ Diamond Scanner V2 (finds pre-breakout stocks)
2. ✅ PROCEDURES.md (standard operating procedures)
3. ✅ test_systems.py (system validation)
4. ✅ 6x daily scan automation via cron

## Mistakes Made
1. ❌ Missed market close report at 1:30 PM (saw cron trigger but didn't act)
2. ❌ Had trouble with Alpaca API (wrong URL format)
3. ❌ Scanner ran but forgot to send alerts initially

## Fixes Applied
- Created PROCEDURES.md with exact steps
- Documented correct Alpaca API format
- Added mandatory Telegram alert checklist
- Updated AGENTS.md to require reading PROCEDURES.md

## Scanner Test Positions
- **CFLT:** 3 shares @ $30.45 (close: $30.35, -0.3%)
- **KRE:** 1 share @ $70.81 (close: $71.20, +0.5%)

Both are flat - need tomorrow to validate scanner.

## Root Cause of Missed Scans
Cron jobs ARE firing. System messages like "⏰ POWER HOUR SCAN: Run diamond_scanner.py" were being treated as notifications instead of COMMANDS TO EXECUTE.

**Fix:** When I see a cron systemEvent with a command, RUN IT immediately.

## Tomorrow's Test (Feb 4)
**If I execute all 6 scans and send alerts, the system works.**
**If I miss any, we adjust the approach.**

Schedule:
- 6:00 AM: Premarket scan
- 9:30 AM: Market open scan
- 12:00 PM: Midday scan
- 1:00 PM: Market close P&L
- 2:00 PM: Power hour scan
- 4:00 PM: After-hours check

## Files Created Today
- PROCEDURES.md (standard operating procedures)
- diamond_scanner.py (v2 - finds pre-breakout stocks)
- test_systems.py (system validation)
- FIXES_COMPLETED.md (what was fixed)
