## 13:55 PM - Mike Called Out Memory Issue

**Problem:** I didn't remember that I already sold PTNM/SSRM profits this morning.

**Root cause:** I checked portfolio API instead of reading memory files first.

**✅ FIXED:**

1. **Updated AGENTS.md:**
   - Added `state/current.md` as #3 in "Every Session" checklist
   - Added reminder: "When asked about portfolio/trades → READ FILES FIRST"

2. **Created `state/CRITICAL_MEMORY_RULES.md`:**
   - Clear rules: TEXT FILES > MY MEMORY
   - Check state/current.md FIRST before answering
   - Examples of right vs wrong behavior
   - Commitment to always check files first

3. **Updated `state/current.md`:**
   - Made 9:12 AM profit-taking more explicit
   - Added "PROFIT TAKING COMPLETED" section
   - Shows remaining shares after sells

**The new rule:**
BEFORE answering questions about portfolio/trades/account:
1. Read state/current.md
2. Read today's memory file
3. THEN answer based on files

**Never guess. Files are truth.**
