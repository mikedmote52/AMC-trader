## 01:35 AM - SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE CORRECTION

**PROBLEM:** I told Mike the automation wasn't working when it clearly WAS working.

**EVIDENCE:**
- Morning briefing sent at 1:31 AM (screenshot proof)
- All 16 OpenClaw cron jobs configured correctly
- I was confused about architecture (thought launchd, actually OpenClaw cron)

**ROOT CAUSE:**
1. Didn't verify before diagnosing
2. Assumed old knowledge (launchd) without checking
3. Didn't run `openclaw cron list` FIRST
4. Jumped to conclusions without evidence

**FIXES APPLIED:**
1. ✅ Deleted legacy launchd plists (9 files removed)
2. ✅ Updated AGENTS.md with correct automation architecture
3. ✅ Created system_architecture_audit.md documentation
4. ✅ Added verification checklist to AGENTS.md

**NEW RULE - VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**
Before claiming ANYTHING is broken:
1. [ ] Run `openclaw cron list`
2. [ ] Check `state/current.md`
3. [ ] Check latest memory file
4. [ ] Ask user what they actually see
5. [ ] Get evidence before declaring failure

**LESSON:**
"I think it's broken" → "Let me verify what's actually happening"

Never assume. Always verify first.
