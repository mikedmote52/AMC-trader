## 4:23 PM - SYSTEM REBUILD

**What Mike said:** "I want the system to run how it needs to run in order to continually make income with investing."

**What I realized:**
- I built the infrastructure but never executed
- portfolio_tracking.csv exists but empty thesis columns
- daily_portfolio_review.py was referenced but never written
- Routines documented but never followed
- I sat idle all day while money was on the line

**What I fixed:**

### Built Core Scripts:
1. **daily_portfolio_review.py** - Run at market close
   - Updates portfolio_tracking.csv with current prices
   - Flags stop-losses and profit targets
   - Logs daily snapshot to portfolio_daily_log.csv
   - Generates action report

2. **execute_trade.py** - Enforces discipline
   - Requires thesis before buying
   - Checks $300 daily limit
   - Confirms with user before executing
   - Logs trade to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md

3. **morning_briefing.py** - Daily status at 6 AM
   - Portfolio overnight status
   - Stop-losses triggered?
   - Positions at risk
   - Profit-taking opportunities
   - Top 3 priorities

### Deployed Automation:
- ✅ Cron: Morning briefing @ 6:00 AM (delivers to Telegram)
- ✅ Cron: Portfolio check @ 9:30 AM
- ✅ Cron: Midday check @ 11:00 AM
- ✅ Cron: Power hour check @ 12:00 PM
- ✅ Cron: Market close review @ 1:00 PM (delivers to Telegram)

### Current Portfolio Status:
- **Value:** $101,518.99
- **Positions:** 18 stocks
- **Actions needed:**
  - PTNM: +368% - trailing stop already set
  - KSS, UEC, SSRM: +30-42% - scale out 50% tomorrow
  - LGN: +23.7% - set trailing stop
  - UUUU: -12.2% - approaching stop-loss
  - COOK, SPHR: Small losers - exit

**Expected profit lock tomorrow:** ~$180

## Lessons Learned

**Building ≠ Executing:**
- Had CSV files but never updated them
- Had routines documented but never followed them
- Had the idea of daily_portfolio_review.py but never wrote it

**The fix:**
- Automated cron jobs that FORCE execution
- Scripts that require thesis before buying
- Daily reviews that run automatically
- Alerts that deliver to Telegram

**Mike's point:** My job is to make decisions that make him money. Not document processes. Not build infrastructure. **Make money.**

## Tomorrow's Execution

**6:00 AM:** Morning briefing runs automatically  
**9:30 AM:** Execute profit-taking trades (KSS, UEC, SSRM, LGN)  
**Throughout day:** Auto-checks monitor positions  
**1:00 PM:** Market close review runs automatically  

No more sitting idle. No more "I forgot." The system forces execution now.
