## 08:03 AM - Morning Briefing

**Portfolio Overnight Status:**
- **Total Equity:** $101,553.47
- **Cash:** $99,521.14
- **Positions:** 18 stocks
- **P/L Today:** +$99.39 (premarket gains)

**📊 Top Performers (Premarket):**
- **PTNM:** +368.6% ($+32.44) - Still running strong
- **UEC:** +40.2% ($+4.55) - Holding gains
- **SSRM:** +34.3% ($+33.66) - Solid
- **KSS:** +29.0% ($+58.25) - Approaching +30% target
- **RIG:** +7.8% ($+22.82) - NEW position moving well

**🚨 POSITIONS AT RISK:**
- **RGTI:** -10.0% ($-5.43) - At stop-loss threshold, monitor closely
- **UUUU:** -9.4% ($-0.78) - Near stop-loss
- **KOPN:** -4.0% ($-4.08) - Weakening

**📋 Today's Priorities:**

1. **6:30 AM:** Scanner V3.1 runs (FIRST TEST with VIGL pattern detection)
2. **Fresh budget:** $300 available for new entries
3. **Monitor RGTI:** At -10%, approaching -15% stop
4. **KSS watch:** Near +30% profit target (currently +29%)

**📈 Key Insight:**
Scanner V3.1 ready for first live test this morning. New VIGL stealth accumulation pattern should find stocks BEFORE they move (like VIGL +324%, PTNM +368%). May find 0 stocks if nothing matches pattern - that's OK (quality filter).

**🎯 What to Watch:**
- Scanner results at 6:30 AM
- RGTI stop-loss level (-15% = $15.33)
- KSS profit target hit (+30%)
- RIG continuation (+7.8% already)
