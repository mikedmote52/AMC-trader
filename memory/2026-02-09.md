## 01:11 PM - Mike Asked About Date/Time Issues

**Problem identified:** I've been consistently wrong about dates/times
- Said "Sunday" when it was Monday
- Said markets closed when they're open
- Failed to report automated briefing results

**Root cause:** Not trusting system context date, misreading timestamps

**Fix needed:** Always check `date` command, trust system context

## 01:12 PM - Trade Plan Confirmed

Mike approved:
1. Cut COOK (stop-loss hit)
2. Scale out 50% of PTNM, UEC, SSRM, LGN (profit targets hit)
3. Asked about best buys - told him scanner picks all extended, wait for tomorrow

**Status:** Awaiting "execute" command to place orders

## 01:18 PM - Scanner V3 Development Started

**Task:** Enhance diamond_scanner.py with 3 improvements:
1. Intraday VWAP tracking (5-min bars, breakout detection)
2. Sector rotation detection (hot sectors TODAY)
3. Real-time breakout signals

**Approach:** Coordinating with Claude Code (running in terminal s001)
- Created SCANNER_V3_TASK.md with full spec
- Mike will give Claude Code the task
- I'll monitor progress and verify when complete

**API Access Verified:**
- ✅ Polygon intraday bars (5-min) - YES
- ✅ Sector snapshots - YES
- ❌ Options data - Blocked (need premium)

**Expected result:** Scanner goes from 170 max points → 230 max points

## 06:19 PM - Scanner V3 Delivered by Claude Code

**Status:** ✅ Complete, ⚠️ Rate limiting issue

**What was built:**
1. ✅ Intraday VWAP tracking (5-min bars)
2. ✅ Sector rotation detector (new `sector_tracker.py`)
3. ✅ Breakout detection (consolidation + expansion)
4. ✅ Scoring upgraded 170 → 230 max points

**Test results:**
- Found 10 diamonds including RIG (125 pts with VWAP spike)
- VWAP data showing in results: "Above VWAP + volume spike"
- Sector labels present: "DRILLING OIL & GAS WELLS"

**Issue:** Scanner hangs on live run (sector API rate limiting)
- `sector_tracker.py` calls `get_ticker_details()` for every stock
- Polygon rate limit: 5 req/sec
- Need to cache sector data or disable for production

**Next:** Wait for Mike's decision on fix approach

## 06:39 PM - Telegram Integration Complete

**Status:** ✅ All scripts now send phone alerts

**What Claude Code built:**
1. ✅ `scripts/telegram_alert.py` - Core alert system
2. ✅ `scripts/morning_briefing.py` - Enhanced with Telegram
3. ✅ `scripts/daily_portfolio_review.py` - Enhanced with Telegram
4. ✅ Telegram credentials configured (`secrets/telegram.json`)
5. ✅ Test message sent successfully

**Verified working:**
- Morning briefing generates and sends to Telegram
- Scanner alerts format correctly
- Position alerts ready (stop-loss, profit targets)

**Ready for Tuesday:**
- 6:00 AM: Morning briefing → Phone notification
- 6:30 AM: Premarket scan → Phone notification (if diamonds)
- 1:00 PM: Daily review → Phone notification

**Cron job issue identified:**
- 16 jobs total (duplicates)
- Multiple jobs at same times
- Need cleanup - offered to Mike

💡 **Lesson:** Automated systems ARE working - I'm just not reading/reporting their output properly
💡 **Lesson #2:** Claude Code delivers, but production testing catches real-world issues
💡 **Lesson #3:** Claude Code + OpenClaw coordination works perfectly - Scanner V3 + Telegram in one session
