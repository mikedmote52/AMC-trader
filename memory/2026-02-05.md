## Critical Mindset Shift

Mike said: "Your job is to make the most money over time and learn from your decisions"

This means:
- **I should be making trade recommendations**, not just asking permission
- **I should learn from outcomes** and adjust strategy
- **I should be proactive** about portfolio management
- **I need to track my decisions and their results**

## Current Portfolio Analysis (3:54 PM)

### Winners Needing Action:
1. **PTNM: +368.6% ($56.77 unrealized)**
   - Trailing stop @ $9.279 (10% below peak)
   - Current: $10.31
   - **Decision needed:** This is an insane gain. Lock more profit or let it ride?

2. **KSS: +22.1% ($44.39 unrealized)**
   - Near +30% profit target
   - **Decision:** Scale out 50% soon

3. **SSRM: +16.4% ($31.07 unrealized)**
   - Building nicely
   - **Decision:** Let it run toward +20%

### Losers Past Stop-Loss:
1. **UUUU: -21.6% ($-1.79)** - Fractional position, minimal damage
2. **RGTI: -19.9% ($-10.77)** - Real loss, thesis broken
3. **KOPN: -8.5% ($-8.60)** - Weak
4. **SERV: -8.4% ($-8.20)** - Weak
5. **SPHR: -7.4% ($-14.14)** - Remnant from profit-taking
6. **COOK: -6.3% ($-6.46)** - Dead money

**Total drag from losers: ~$44**
**Total unrealized gains from winners: ~$227**

### What I Missed Today:
- SITM (+18.6%), FORM (+17.6%), KLIC (+15.8%)
- Why: No premarket scanning
- Scanner ran at 2 PM but alerts didn't reach you (delivery broken - now fixed)

## My Trading Decisions for Tomorrow Morning:

### 1. CUT THE LOSERS (Market Open)
- **Exit RGTI** (3 shares @ market) - thesis broken, -19.9%
- **Exit UUUU** (0.34 shares @ market) - fractional position, -21.6%
- **Exit KOPN** (43 shares @ market) - weak momentum, -8.5%
- **Exit SERV** (10 shares @ market) - no recovery, -8.4%

**Rationale:** Stop loss rule is -15%. These are bleeding the portfolio. Cut them fast, redeploy capital to winners.

**Projected recovery:** ~$29 in cash, stops further losses

### 2. SCALE PTNM (Market Open)
- **Sell 3 more shares @ market** (leaving 4 shares)
- Lock ~$24 profit
- Let final 4 shares ride with trailing stop

**Rationale:** +368% is life-changing territory. We already sold 6 shares. Lock more profit while letting some run. Trailing stop protects the rest.

### 3. WATCH KSS
- If it hits $17.85 (+25%), scale out 50% (7 shares)
- Lock ~$24 profit
- Let 7 shares run toward +30%

### 4. NEW ENTRIES
- Wait for 6 AM premarket scan results
- Budget: $300 + recovered ~$29 = ~$329 available
- Look for pre-breakout setups (+3-10%, not chasing)

## Lessons to Track:

**What worked:**
- Selling 50% of big winners (PTNM, WULF earlier)
- Trailing stops protecting gains

**What didn't work:**
- Holding losers past -15% stop-loss
- Not cutting RGTI/UUUU immediately when they broke down
- Missing premarket movers (scanner delivery was broken)

**System issues fixed today:**
- Scanner delivery routing (added Telegram ID)
- Should get 6 AM premarket alerts starting tomorrow

## Tomorrow's Plan:

**6:00 AM - Premarket:**
- Receive automated scanner alert
- Review overnight news
- Execute exit orders on RGTI/UUUU/KOPN/SERV
- Execute PTNM partial profit-taking

**9:30 AM - Market Open:**
- Confirm fills
- Watch for entry signals from scanner

**12:00 PM - Midday:**
- Receive scanner alert
- Check for new setups

**3:00 PM - Market Close:**
- Review daily performance
- Update this log with outcomes
