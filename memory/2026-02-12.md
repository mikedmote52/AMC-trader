- Fixed AMC-trader dashboard startup when Alpaca credentials are missing by adding offline simulation fallback mode.
- Updated setup verifier and README to reflect OpenClaw credential + offline behavior.
- Removed BOOTSTRAP.md after first-run initialization per workspace instructions.
- Follow-up cleanup: normalized Alpaca base URL parsing to avoid double /v2, removed bare except blocks, and made debug mode opt-in via FLASK_DEBUG.
- Fixed stock search reliability: replaced fragile yfinance `info`-first flow with history-based fetch + success-only cache and offline fallback analysis response when market data provider is unavailable.
