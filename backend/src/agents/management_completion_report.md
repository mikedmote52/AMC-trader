```python
Condition: Consistently low candidates (<3) + High error rates (>10%)
Timeout: 60 minutes  
Action: INTEGRATE_REAL_DATA
Priority: HIGH
```
**Recovery Actions**: Validate data providers → Refresh market data → Quality validation

### **Rule 3: Algorithm Quality Threshold**
```python
Condition: Very low candidates (<2) + System DEGRADED + Slow responses (>20s)
Timeout: 45 minutes
Action: VALIDATE_ALGORITHMS  
Priority: MEDIUM
```
**Recovery Actions**: Test scoring strategies → Validate algorithms → Performance analysis

### **Rule 4: High Error Rate Emergency**
```python
Condition: Error rate >20%
Timeout: 15 minutes
Action: EMERGENCY_RESTART
Priority: CRITICAL  
```
**Recovery Actions**: Comprehensive system restart → Full validation → Recovery verification
