# ðŸš¨ SQUEEZE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM - VIGL Pattern Recognition

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission Accomplished: Squeeze-Specific Intelligence

The AMC-TRADER thesis system now includes **VIGL pattern recognition** with squeeze-specific intelligence for identifying high-reward opportunities like the +324% VIGL winner.

## ðŸ§  Enhanced Capabilities

### 1. VIGL Pattern Recognition âœ…
- **Historical Reference Data**: VIGL (+324%), CRWV (+515%), AEVA (+345%)
- **Multi-Dimensional Similarity Scoring**: Volume, short interest, float size, price range
- **Dynamic Confidence Adjustment**: Based on pattern similarity (70%+ = high confidence)

### 2. Squeeze-Specific Thesis Generation âœ…
```python
async def generate_squeeze_thesis(self, symbol, metrics):
    if metrics.get('squeeze_score', 0) > 0.75:
        thesis = f"ðŸš¨ EXTREME SQUEEZE ALERT: {symbol} showing VIGL-like pattern with "
        thesis += f"{metrics['volume_spike']:.1f}x volume spike. "
        thesis += f"Short interest {metrics['short_interest']:.1%} with only {metrics['float']/1e6:.1f}M float. "
        
        # Pattern similarity analysis
        if best_match['similarity'] > 0.70:
            thesis += f"{best_match['similarity']:.0%} similar to {best_match['pattern']} "
            thesis += f"before +{best_match['max_gain']:.0f}% move. "
        
        thesis += "CRITICAL: Set stops at -8% for risk management."
```

### 3. Pattern-Specific Recommendations âœ…

#### VIGL Pattern â†’ Aggressive Accumulation Below $5
- **Action**: `AGGRESSIVE_ACCUMULATION`
- **Position Sizing**: 2-3% of portfolio maximum
- **Entry Strategy**: Scale in on volume spikes and dips  
- **Risk Management**: Strict -8% stop loss, no exceptions

#### Momentum Fade â†’ Trim 50% on First Double
- **Trigger**: +100% gains with fading momentum
- **Action**: `TRIM_50` immediate execution
- **Logic**: Lock in gains while monitoring remaining position

#### Breakdown â†’ Immediate Exit
- **Signal**: Pattern integrity compromised
- **Action**: `IMMEDIATE_EXIT` within 24 hours
- **Priority**: Capital preservation over bounce hopes

### 4. Historical Pattern Matching âœ…

**Pattern Database:**
```python
HISTORICAL_SQUEEZE_PATTERNS = {
    'VIGL': {
        'max_gain': 324.0,
        'volume_spike': 20.9,
        'float_size': 15.2e6,
        'short_interest': 0.18,
        'pattern_duration': 14,
        'characteristics': ['extreme_volume', 'small_float', 'high_short_interest']
    }
}
```

**Similarity Algorithm:**
- Volume Spike: 40% weight
- Short Interest: 30% weight  
- Float Size: 20% weight
- Price Range: 10% weight

### 5. Learning Feedback Loop âœ…

**Accuracy Tracking:**
- Tracks thesis accuracy vs. actual outcomes
- Adjusts confidence scoring based on historical performance
- Pattern-specific success rate monitoring

**Adaptive Confidence:**
- VIGL patterns: +0.15 confidence boost (historically proven)
- Breakdown patterns: +0.10 boost (clear signals)
- Failed patterns: -0.10 confidence adjustment
