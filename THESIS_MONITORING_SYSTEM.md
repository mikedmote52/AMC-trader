# AMC-TRADER Automated Thesis Monitoring System

## Overview

The Automated Thesis Monitoring System transforms the existing investment thesis generation into actionable real-time monitoring rules. Instead of static thesis text like "ANTE: BUY MORE • 80% CONFIDENCE - VIGL pattern developing", the system now automatically parses thesis criteria and creates intelligent monitoring that alerts when conditions are met or violated.

## Key Features

### 1. **Intelligent Thesis Parsing**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatically extracts monitoring conditions from thesis text
- **Threshold Detection**: Identifies percentage, price, and ratio thresholds
- **Priority Assessment**: Determines alert urgency based on context and condition types
- **Timeframe Extraction**: Understands temporal contexts (intraday, short-term, etc.)

### 2. **Real-Time Condition Monitoring**
- **Live Market Data Integration**: Uses Polygon API and existing BMS engine
- **Multi-Condition Evaluation**: Monitors momentum, volume, price action, and risk factors
- **Smart Thresholds**: Dynamic thresholds based on historical patterns and market context
- **Continuous Checking**: Background monitoring with configurable intervals

### 3. **Actionable Alert System**
- **Priority-Based Notifications**: Critical, High, Medium, Low priority levels
- **Contextual Messages**: Intelligent notifications explaining what happened and why
- **Portfolio-Wide Monitoring**: Track all positions simultaneously
- **Mobile-Friendly Interface**: Web dashboard for real-time monitoring

### 4. **Learning Integration**
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Monitors thesis prediction accuracy over time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns which conditions are most predictive
- **Adaptive Scoring**: Improves confidence scoring based on historical performance
- **Feedback Loops**: Integrates with existing thesis accuracy tracker

## Monitoring Conditions

### Pattern Recognition Categories

1. **Momentum Patterns**
   - `momentum_continue`: "let momentum continue", "maintain momentum"
   - `momentum_acceleration`: "momentum accelerating", "gaining steam"
   - `momentum_stalling`: "momentum stalling", "losing steam"

2. **Volume Patterns**
   - `volume_expansion`: "volume surge", "high volume"
   - `volume_decline`: "volume drying up", "low volume"

3. **Price Action Patterns**
   - `price_breakout`: "breakout", "above resistance"
   - `price_breakdown`: "breakdown", "below support"
   - `signs_of_topping`: "signs of topping", "exhaustion signs"

4. **Risk Management Patterns**
   - `profit_taking`: "take profits", "trim position"
   - `stop_loss_trigger`: "stop loss", "cut losses"

### Example Thesis Parsing

**Input Thesis**: "ANTE: BUY MORE • 80% CONFIDENCE - VIGL pattern developing. Let momentum continue while monitoring for signs of topping above $15."

**Extracted Conditions**:
- `momentum_continue` (Medium priority, threshold: continuation)
- `signs_of_topping` (High priority, threshold: $15.00 price level)
- Confidence: 80%, Recommendation: BUY_MORE

**Generated Alerts**:
- 🟡 "ANTE momentum continuing - thesis validation on track"
- 🔴 "ANTE showing signs of topping above $15 - consider profit taking"

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: UP Cannabis Stock
**Original Thesis**: "UP: TRIM POSITION - Lock in spectacular +107% gains. This exceptional performance warrants profit-taking to protect capital."

**Monitoring Rules Created**:
- `profit_taking` condition (Critical priority, threshold: 100%+ gains)
- `capital_preservation` condition (High priority)

**Generated Alert**: "🚨 CRITICAL: UP - Exceptional gains require immediate profit-taking. Consider selling 50-75% to lock in gains."

### Example 2: WOOF Early Development
**Original Thesis**: "WOOF: BUY MORE • 60% CONFIDENCE - Early +8.0% gains suggest thesis developing. Watch for momentum acceleration or stalling."

**Monitoring Rules Created**:
- `momentum_acceleration` condition (Medium priority, threshold: >5% momentum)
- `momentum_stalling` condition (Medium priority, threshold: <2% momentum)

**Potential Alerts**:
- 🟡 "WOOF momentum accelerating - thesis validation strengthening"
- 🟡 "WOOF momentum stalling - watch for consolidation or reversal"

### Example 3: VIGL Pattern Recognition
**Original Thesis**: "QUBT: EXTREME SQUEEZE ALERT - 20.5x volume spike with VIGL-like pattern. 85% similar to VIGL before +324% move."

**Monitoring Rules Created**:
- `volume_expansion` condition (Critical priority, threshold: 15x+ volume)
- `price_breakout` condition (High priority)
- `squeeze_momentum` condition (High priority)

**Generated Alerts**:
- 🚨 "QUBT VIGL-pattern volume surge detected - extreme squeeze conditions met"
- 🔴 "QUBT breakout confirmed - pattern similarity suggests significant upside potential"

## Performance and Scalability

### System Performance
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second condition evaluation
