## ðŸ”„ Integration with Existing Systems

### Discovery Algorithm Integration
The learning system automatically provides adaptive parameters to the discovery algorithm:

```python
# In discovery job (src/jobs/discover.py)
from services.learning_engine import get_learning_engine

async def get_optimized_discovery_params():
    learning_engine = await get_learning_engine()
    return await learning_engine.get_adaptive_discovery_parameters()

# Use adaptive parameters instead of static ones
adaptive_params = await get_optimized_discovery_params()
EXPLOSIVE_VOLUME_MIN = adaptive_params.get('explosive_volume_min', 5.0)
VIGL_THRESHOLD = adaptive_params.get('vigl_threshold', 0.65)
```

### Thesis Generation Enhancement
Thesis generation can use learning insights for improved accuracy:

```python
# In thesis generation (src/services/thesis_generator.py)
from services.learning_engine import get_learning_engine

async def generate_enhanced_thesis(symbol, position_data):
    learning_engine = await get_learning_engine()
    
    # Get pattern similarity to historical winners
    current_features = extract_pattern_features(position_data)
    similarity = await learning_engine.get_pattern_similarity_score(current_features)
    
    # Use similarity to adjust confidence
    enhanced_confidence = base_confidence * (1 + similarity * 0.3)
    
    return enhanced_thesis
```

### Real-time Parameter Updates
The system uses Redis for real-time parameter distribution:

```python
from shared.redis_client import get_redis_client

def get_current_learning_parameters():
    redis_client = get_redis_client()
    params_json = redis_client.get("amc:learning:current_parameters")
    
    if params_json:
        return json.loads(params_json.decode())['parameters']
    else:
        return default_parameters
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Learning Feedback Loops

### 1. Discovery Performance Tracking
```python
# Log discovery performance for learning (automated)
await log_discovery_performance(
    discovery_date=datetime.now(),
    symbols_discovered=len(contenders),
    avg_7d_return=track_7day_performance(contenders),
    success_rate=calculate_success_rate(contenders),
    explosive_winners=count_explosive_winners(contenders)
)
```

### 2. Thesis Outcome Learning
```python
# Learn from thesis accuracy (automated via position tracking)
await learning_engine.learn_from_thesis_outcome(
    symbol=symbol,
    thesis_data=original_thesis,
    actual_returns={
        '1d': actual_1d_return,
        '7d': actual_7d_return, 
        '30d': actual_30d_return
    }
)
```

### 3. Pattern Success Learning
```python  
# When an explosive winner is confirmed
await learning_engine.learn_from_explosive_winner(
    symbol=symbol,
    discovery_features=original_discovery_features,
    outcome_return=final_return_pct,
    days_held=holding_period

### Common Issues

**Learning system not updating parameters:**
- Check Redis connection: `curl "https://amc-trader.onrender.com/health"`
- Verify learning job execution: Check logs in `/learning-analytics/learning/performance-summary`
- Manual parameter refresh: Run `python run_learning_cycle.py --dry-run`

**Low pattern similarity scores:**
- Insufficient historical data: Log more explosive winners
- Feature mismatch: Verify discovery features match pattern expectations
- Market regime mismatch: Check if current regime has sufficient training data

**Poor thesis accuracy:**
- Review prediction vs outcome correlation in `/thesis/accuracy-analysis`
- Check if confidence calibration needs adjustment
- Verify market context factors are being considered

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check learning system health
curl "https://amc-trader.onrender.com/learning-analytics/learning/performance-summary"

# Test learning cycle without changes
python run_learning_cycle.py --dry-run --verbose

# Initialize fresh learning tables
python run_learning_cycle.py --init-only

# Get current adaptive parameters
