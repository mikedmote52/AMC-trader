## 🔥 **VIGL Pattern Detection**

### **Historical Pattern Analysis**
The system includes detailed analysis of historical squeeze winners:

```python
HISTORICAL_SQUEEZE_PATTERNS = {
    'VIGL': {
        'entry_price': 2.94,
        'peak_price': 12.46, 
        'max_gain': 324.0,
        'volume_spike': 20.9,  # 20.9x average volume
        'pattern_duration': 14,  # Days to peak
        'characteristics': ['extreme_volume', 'small_float', 'high_short_interest']
    }
}
```

### **Real-Time Pattern Matching**
- **Volume Spike Detection**: Alerts when volume exceeds 15x average
- **Price Range Optimization**: Focus on $1-8 range for best squeeze potential  
- **Float Size Analysis**: Small float (<100M) increases squeeze probability
- **Short Interest Tracking**: High short interest (>10%) creates squeeze fuel

### **AI-Enhanced Thesis Generation**
- **Claude Integration**: Sophisticated analysis using Claude-3.5-Sonnet
- **Pattern-Specific Recommendations**: VIGL_SQUEEZE vs STANDARD analysis
- **Dynamic Confidence Scoring**: Adapts based on historical pattern success
- **Risk Management Integration**: Automatic stop-loss recommendations
