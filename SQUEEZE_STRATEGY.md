# SQUEEZE STRATEGY - The Real Framework

**Based on actual 63.8% returns from June 1 – July 4 tracker**
*(VIGL, CRWV, AEVA, CRDO, SEZL, NVDA, TSLA, SMCI)*

---

## 🎯 Core Objective

Identify **early-stage imbalance stocks** where demand is rising faster than available supply, **before** the parabolic move is obvious.

**These are not "best companies" — they are best setups.**

---

## 1️⃣ Universe Filter (Must Pass First)

**80% of stocks die here. Hard filters (non-negotiable):**

- ✅ **Price:** $0.50 – $100
- ✅ **Market cap:** Small–mid cap preferred, but large caps allowed only if options + volume confirm
- ✅ **Avg daily volume (30D):** ≥ 1M shares
- ✅ **Today's volume:** ≥ 3× 30-day average (sustained, not a single candle)

**Why this mattered:**
- VIGL, CRWV, AEVA all showed abnormal volume expansion early
- NVDA/TSLA only worked because options + gamma replaced float constraints

---

## 2️⃣ Early Momentum Signature (MOST IMPORTANT)

**This is how winners separated themselves from noise.**

**Required pattern (at least 3 of 4):**

1. ✅ **Intraday % gain:** +5% to +20% (not +60% already)
2. ✅ **Holds or reclaims VWAP** after first push
3. ✅ **Higher lows** on 5–15 min chart
4. ✅ **Multi-day structure:** 2–4 green days in last 5

**Why:**
- VIGL was not a breakout day 1 — it was an early imbalance
- Late-stage spikes are excluded on purpose

---

## 3️⃣ Supply Constraint (The Squeeze Engine)

**This is why returns were asymmetric.**

### **A) Float-Based Squeeze (small caps)**

**At least ONE must be true:**

- ✅ Float ≤ 50M
- ✅ Short interest ≥ 20%
- ✅ Days-to-cover ≥ 3
- ✅ Borrow fee ≥ 20%
- ✅ Utilization ≥ 85%

### **B) Gamma-Based Squeeze (large caps)**

**If float > 150M:**

- ✅ Near-the-money call OI rising
- ✅ Call/put ratio ≥ 2
- ✅ Short-dated expirations active (≤ 30 DTE)
- ✅ IV percentile ≥ 80

**Why:**
- VIGL / CRWV = float + short pressure
- NVDA / TSLA / SMCI = options-driven demand spiral

---

## 4️⃣ Verified Catalyst (No "Hope Trades")

**A move without a reason fades.**

**At least ONE required:**

- ✅ Earnings beat or guidance surprise
- ✅ FDA / regulatory / contract news
- ✅ Insider buying
- ✅ M&A / strategic partnership
- ✅ Exploding social attention with volume confirmation

**❌ Not allowed:**
- "Chatter only"
- Old news with no volume response

**Why:**
- Every big winner had a reason + money
- Social buzz only counted when paired with volume

---

## 5️⃣ Sentiment Acceleration (Timing Edge)

**Not sentiment level — rate of change.**

**Positive signals:**

- ✅ News sentiment turning positive **this week**
- ✅ Reddit / StockTwits mentions accelerating day-over-day
- ✅ YouTube / X mentions appearing **before** mainstream media

**Why:**
- This is how VIGL & AEVA were early
- Late sentiment = exit liquidity

---

## 6️⃣ Technical Health (Entry Precision)

**Used for when, not what.**

**Ideal zone:**

- ✅ **RSI:** 60–70 (momentum, not overbought)
- ✅ **ATR:** ≥ 4% of price (needs room to move)
- ✅ **9 EMA** crossing or holding above 20 EMA
- ✅ **Price above VWAP** or reclaiming it with volume

**Why:**
- Prevents chasing tops
- Improves average entry → higher R multiples

---

## 7️⃣ Scoring Thresholds (How the Basket Was Built)

**This is how the 63.8% basket return was possible.**

### **Scoring:**

- **Score ≥ 75** → Trade-ready (core allocation)
- **Score 70–74** → Watch / starter size
- **Score < 70** → Ignore

### **Positioning:**

- **$100 per stock** (or $150-300 for Mike's account)
- Accept 1–2 losers (like WOLF)
- Winners pay for everything

---

## 8️⃣ Why This Replicated Those Returns

**That basket worked because:**

✅ Losses were capped
✅ Winners were allowed to run
✅ Selection favored imbalance + timing, not prediction

**This framework intentionally:**

- Finds 10–20 candidates
- Expects 2–4 outsized winners
- Lets math, not conviction, do the work

---

## 🔧 Implementation Notes

### **Data Sources:**

- **Polygon.io MCP** for:
  - Price, volume, float, short interest
  - Options data (OI, IV, calls/puts)
  - Intraday bars (5/15 min for patterns)
  - News sentiment

### **Scanner Output:**

- Top 10-20 stocks ranked by score
- Present top 5 as "trade-ready" (≥75)
- Next 5 as "watch list" (70-74)
- Rest ignored

### **Frequency:**

- Run 6x daily (premarket, open, midday, power hour, close, after hours)
- Alert Mike on new ≥75 scores
- Update watch list daily
