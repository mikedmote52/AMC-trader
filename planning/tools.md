- **Processing Pipeline**:
  1. Fetch current positions from Alpaca broker
  2. Enrich with real-time price data from Polygon
  3. Calculate position-level health scores
  4. Aggregate portfolio-level health metrics
  5. Apply VIGL pattern scoring weights
  6. Generate health alerts and recommendations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with cached data, fallback to basic metrics if AI unavailable

### VIGL Pattern Health Integrator
- **Purpose**: Integrate VIGL squeeze detection scores into position health calculations
- **Dependencies**: [SqueezeDetector Service, Historical Pattern Database, Thesis Generator]
- **Processing Pipeline**:
  1. Retrieve VIGL pattern confidence scores
  2. Map pattern similarity to health multipliers
  3. Apply historical pattern success rates
  4. Weight by current market conditions
  5. Generate pattern-specific health insights
- **Error Handling**: Default to standard health calculation if VIGL data unavailable

### Thesis Performance Tracker
- **Purpose**: Track thesis accuracy and update confidence scoring based on outcomes
- **Dependencies**: [Learning System Database, Performance Analytics, Market Data]
- **Processing Pipeline**:
  1. Monitor position performance vs thesis predictions
  2. Calculate thesis accuracy metrics
  3. Update confidence scoring algorithms
  4. Log learning data for system improvement
  5. Generate thesis status updates
- **Error Handling**: Queue failed updates for retry, maintain thesis history integrity

### Smart Position Organizer
- **Purpose**: Risk-based position sorting and grouping with intelligent categorization
- **Dependencies**: [Portfolio Health Calculator, Thesis Tracker, Market Conditions]
- **Processing Pipeline**:
  1. Calculate composite risk scores per position
  2. Apply thesis status weighting
  3. Group by risk categories and sectors
  4. Sort by action priority (urgent â†’ monitor)
  5. Generate organization metadata
- **Error Handling**: Fall back to simple P&L sorting if advanced metrics fail

## Signal Generators

### Portfolio Health Score Generator
- **Calculation Method**:
```python
health_score = (
    position_performance_score * 0.35 +
    risk_management_score * 0.25 +
    diversification_score * 0.20 +
    thesis_confirmation_score * 0.15 +
    momentum_score * 0.05
)

# With VIGL pattern boost
if vigl_pattern_detected:
    health_score += vigl_confidence * 0.10
```
- **Input Requirements**: [Position P&L, Sector allocation, Thesis status, VIGL scores, Market momentum]
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time during market hours, every 5 minutes after hours
- **Validation Rules**: Score must be 0-100, validate input data quality, flag anomalies

### Position Health Status Generator
- **Calculation Method**:
```python
position_health = {
    "EXCELLENT": health_score >= 85 and pl_pct > 10,
    "GOOD": health_score >= 70 or (pl_pct > 5 and thesis_confirmed),
    "MODERATE": health_score >= 50 or (pl_pct > -5 and thesis_intact),
    "AT_RISK": health_score >= 30 or (pl_pct > -15 and stop_loss_safe),
    "CRITICAL": health_score < 30 or pl_pct < -20
}
```
- **Input Requirements**: [Health score, P&L percentage, Thesis status, Stop loss distance]
- **Update Frequency**: Every position update (real-time)
- **Validation Rules**: Single status per position, thesis status must be valid enum

### Projected Outcome Calculator
- **Calculation Method**:
```python
# Monte Carlo simulation with historical pattern data
projected_return = (
    base_case_probability * base_case_return +
    bull_case_probability * bull_case_return +
    bear_case_probability * bear_case_return
)

# VIGL pattern historical success rate adjustment
if vigl_pattern_match > 0.8:
    projected_return *= 1.324  # Historical VIGL average return
```
- **Input Requirements**: [Current price, Historical volatility, Thesis targets, Market conditions, Pattern classification]
- **Update Frequency**: Daily after market close, on significant price moves (>5%)
- **Validation Rules**: Projections must include confidence intervals, validate against historical ranges

### Learning System Decision Logger
- **Calculation Method**:
```python
decision_value = {
    "confidence_weighted_return": actual_return * original_confidence,
    "thesis_accuracy_score": 1.0 if thesis_confirmed else 0.0,
    "pattern_success_rate": pattern_wins / pattern_total_decisions,
    "system_improvement_factor": new_accuracy / baseline_accuracy
}
```
- **Input Requirements**: [Original decision data, Current outcomes, Time held, Market context]
