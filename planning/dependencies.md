# Dependencies for AMC-TRADER Fixes - Production Deployment Plan

## Summary
Based on the comprehensive system validation completed on 2025-09-06, critical fixes have been implemented to resolve the squeeze candidate display failure. This deployment plan ensures permanent resolution of configuration mismatches, frontend integration issues, and threshold misalignment that caused 100% candidate rejection.

**Key Fixes Applied:**
1. Strategy configuration correction (legacy_v0 → hybrid_v1)  
2. Threshold calibration to realistic values (50% → 10% entry minimums)
3. Frontend endpoint switch (/advanced-ranking/rank → /discovery/contenders)
4. Volume gate relaxation (1.0x → 0.5x relvol requirements)

## Package Dependencies

### Backend Dependencies (No Changes Required)
- **FastAPI**: Current version sufficient for hybrid_v1 strategy
- **Redis**: 6.x - Already configured for strategy-aware caching
- **PostgreSQL**: Current schema supports all discovery patterns
- **Polygon API**: Integration functional, no version updates needed
- **asyncio**: Native Python support for concurrent discovery processing

**Configuration Note**: All backend dependencies are already satisfied. No package installations required.

### Frontend Dependencies (No Changes Required)
- **React**: 18.x - Current version supports all implemented changes
- **TypeScript**: 4.x - Existing types accommodate discovery response format
- **Node.js**: 16.x+ - No version constraints for the fixes

**Configuration Note**: Frontend fixes are code-level changes only, no dependency updates needed.

## Environment Variables

### Required (Already Configured)
- `POLYGON_API_KEY`: Production API key for market data
  - Format: String (pk_live_xxx format)
  - Example: `POLYGON_API_KEY=pk_live_abcd1234`
  - Used by: Discovery pipeline for real-time data

- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string  
  - Format: redis://host:port/db
  - Example: `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0`
  - Used by: Strategy caching and candidate persistence

- `API_BASE`: Frontend API endpoint
  - Format: https://domain.com (no trailing slash)
  - Example: `API_BASE=https://amc-trader.onrender.com`
  - Used by: Frontend API calls

### New Environment Variables
- `SCORING_STRATEGY`: Strategy selection override (Optional)
  - Format: String (legacy_v0 or hybrid_v1)
  - Default: Uses calibration/active.json configuration
  - Example: `SCORING_STRATEGY=hybrid_v1`
  - Used by: Discovery pipeline for strategy selection

### Configuration Validation
All environment variables are pre-configured in production. No changes required for deployment.

## Configuration File Updates

### Primary Configuration Changes
**File**: `/Users/michaelmote/Desktop/AMC-TRADER/calibration/active.json`

**Critical Updates Applied:**
```json
{
  "scoring": {
    "strategy": "hybrid_v1",         // Changed from legacy_v0
    "preset": "balanced_default"      // Confirmed active
  },
  "hybrid_v1": {
    "thresholds": {
      "min_relvol_30": 0.5,          // Relaxed from 1.0
      "min_atr_pct": 0.02            // Maintained at 2%
    },
    "entry_rules": {
      "watchlist_min": 10,           // Reduced from 50
      "trade_ready_min": 15          // Reduced from 55
    }
  }
}
```

### API Configuration Changes
**No API endpoint modifications required**. The fixes utilize existing discovery endpoints with strategy parameters.

**Active Endpoints:**
- `GET /discovery/contenders?strategy=hybrid_v1` - Primary candidate source
- `GET /discovery/status` - System health monitoring  
- `GET /health` - Application health check
- `POST /discovery/trigger` - Manual discovery execution

## Database Migrations

### Schema Changes
**No database migrations required**. All fixes are configuration and application-level changes.

### Existing Schema Validation
Current database schema supports:
- Discovery candidate storage
- Strategy-specific scoring data
- Historical pattern tracking
- Performance metrics logging

**Schema Compatibility**: 100% compatible with implemented fixes.

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Configuration Deployment (5 minutes)
1. **Verify Configuration File**
   ```bash
   # Confirm active.json contains hybrid_v1 strategy activation
   cat /Users/michaelmote/Desktop/AMC-TRADER/calibration/active.json | jq '.scoring.strategy'
   # Expected: "hybrid_v1"
   ```

2. **Validate Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Confirm required variables are set
   echo $POLYGON_API_KEY | head -c 20
   echo $REDIS_URL
   echo $API_BASE
   ```

### Phase 2: Service Restart (2 minutes)
1. **Backend Service Restart** (Required for configuration reload)
   ```bash
   # Production restart command (Render platform)
   # Manual restart through Render dashboard OR
   # git push to trigger auto-deployment
   
   # Local development restart:
   # Kill existing process and restart
   pkill -f "python.*main.py"
   cd /Users/michaelmote/Desktop/AMC-TRADER/backend
   python src/main.py &
   ```

2. **Redis Cache Invalidation** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   # Clear strategy-specific cache keys to force fresh data
   redis-cli DEL "amc:discovery:contenders.latest"
   redis-cli DEL "amc:discovery:v2:*" 
   redis-cli DEL "amc:discovery:hybrid_v1:*"
   ```

### Phase 3: Frontend Deployment (1 minute)
1. **Frontend Code Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Frontend changes already implemented in SqueezeMonitor.tsx
   # No build process required - React hot reload handles updates
   # For production: git push triggers auto-deployment
   ```

### Phase 4: Validation Testing (5 minutes)
1. **System Health Check**
   ```bash
   # 1. Verify API health
   curl -s "https://amc-trader.onrender.com/health" | jq .
   
   # 2. Test discovery with hybrid_v1
   curl -s "https://amc-trader.onrender.com/discovery/contenders?strategy=hybrid_v1&limit=10" | jq .count
   
   # 3. Verify configuration loading
   curl -s "https://amc-trader.onrender.com/discovery/status" | jq .strategy
   ```

2. **Frontend Functionality Test**
   - Navigate to squeeze monitor interface
   - Verify candidates are displayed (not empty state)
   - Confirm score tiers show realistic percentages (25-40% range)
   - Validate real-time data updates

## Monitoring and Validation Steps

### Immediate Validation (First Hour)
1. **Discovery Pipeline Performance**
   ```bash
   # Monitor candidate discovery rates
   curl -s "https://amc-trader.onrender.com/discovery/test?strategy=hybrid_v1&limit=50" | jq '.candidates | length'
   # Target: 8+ candidates per scan
   ```

2. **Frontend Display Validation**
   - **Expected**: Squeeze opportunities visible in UI
   - **Monitor**: No "No squeeze opportunities detected" when candidates exist
   - **Check**: Score distributions in 25-40% range (not 0%)

3. **Configuration Persistence**
   ```bash
   # Verify strategy remains active after restart
   curl -s "https://amc-trader.onrender.com/discovery/calibration/status" | jq '.strategy'
   # Expected: "hybrid_v1"
   ```

### Continuous Monitoring (First 24 Hours)
1. **System Health Metrics**
   - API response times < 2 seconds
   - Discovery completion rates > 95%
   - Redis cache hit rates > 80%
   - Frontend error rates < 1%

2. **Candidate Quality Metrics**
   - Discovery candidates per scan: 8-25 (target range)
   - Score distribution: 25-45% (realistic range)
   - Volume gate pass rate: 60%+ (improved from 0%)
   - Strategy scoring pass rate: 35%+ (improved from 0%)

3. **User Experience Validation**
   - Frontend displays real opportunities (not perpetually empty)
   - Squeeze alerts functional and actionable
   - Performance monitoring shows engagement

### Alerting Configuration
```bash
# Set up monitoring alerts for critical metrics
# Alert if discovery candidates < 5 for > 30 minutes during market hours
# Alert if frontend errors > 5% for > 10 minutes  
# Alert if API response times > 5 seconds for > 5 minutes
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Components (Implemented)
- **Configuration Parameter Changes**: Easily reversible via active.json
- **Frontend Display Thresholds**: UI-only impact, no data corruption risk
- **Endpoint Switching**: Improves reliability by removing dependencies

### Medium Risk Components (Monitored)
- **Strategy Activation**: legacy_v0 → hybrid_v1 impacts scoring algorithms
- **Volume Requirement Relaxation**: May increase candidate volume
- **Entry Rule Reduction**: Requires candidate quality monitoring

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# EMERGENCY ROLLBACK (30 seconds)
# 1. Revert strategy in configuration
echo '{"scoring":{"strategy":"legacy_v0"}}' > /tmp/rollback.json
cp /tmp/rollback.json /Users/michaelmote/Desktop/AMC-TRADER/calibration/active.json

# 2. Clear cache and restart
redis-cli FLUSHDB
# Restart service (platform-specific)

# 3. Verify rollback
curl -s "https://amc-trader.onrender.com/discovery/status" | jq .strategy
# Expected: "legacy_v0"
```

### Rollback Success Criteria
