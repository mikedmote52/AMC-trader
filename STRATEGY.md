# SqueezeSeeker Trading Strategy

**Mission:** Find stocks with the HIGHEST PROBABILITY of explosive growth (2-5x) over the next few weeks.

## Core Approach

**Multi-signal analysis for explosive potential:**
- Hold time: 2-6 weeks (not day trading)
- Target: +50-300% on winners
- Use ALL available data, not just one signal
- Find stocks BEFORE they explode, not after

## Data Sources (ALL weighted equally)

### 1. Fundamentals
- Revenue growth trend (accelerating?)
- New contracts/partnerships announced
- Product pipeline (launches coming?)
- Market size/TAM expansion
- Competitive advantage emerging

### 2. Technical Analysis
- Price pattern (breakout setup, consolidation ending)
- Volume trend (building over days/weeks, not just one spike)
- Support/resistance levels
- Moving averages (50/200 day)
- RSI, MACD for momentum confirmation

### 3. Upcoming Catalysts (critical)
- Earnings date (2-4 weeks out)
- FDA decisions pending
- Conference presentations
- Product launch dates
- Analyst days
- Contract bid results

### 4. Sector/Theme Analysis
- What themes are starting to heat up? (like quantum in June)
- Sector rotation indicators
- Policy/regulatory tailwinds
- Macro trends (AI boom, EV adoption, biotech innovation)

### 5. Social Signals (confirmation layer)
- Reddit: Quality DD posts, building discussion (not just hype)
- Twitter: Smart money talking, not just pump accounts
- YouTube: Analyst coverage increasing
- Unusual volume + social = confirmation

### 6. Insider/Institutional Activity
- Recent insider buying (execs loading up?)
- Form 4 filings
- Institutional ownership changes
- Short interest (for squeeze potential)

## Entry Criteria (Score-based, not binary)

**Minimum threshold: 7/10 signals present**

Each stock gets scored on 10 factors:

1. **Strong fundamental story** (+1) - Revenue growth, partnerships, or product momentum
2. **Technical setup** (+1) - Consolidation breaking, volume building, above key MAs
3. **Upcoming catalyst** (+2) - Earnings, FDA, launch within 2-4 weeks = DOUBLE WEIGHT
4. **Theme alignment** (+1) - Part of hot sector (AI, quantum, biotech, etc.)
5. **Social confirmation** (+1) - Quality discussion building (not just hype)
6. **Insider buying** (+1) - Recent Form 4 filings showing accumulation
7. **Low float/high short** (+1) - Squeeze potential if momentum hits
8. **Under $100** (+1) - Accessible price
9. **Liquidity** (+1) - Can enter/exit cleanly
10. **No recent blow-off top** (+1) - Not already up 100%+ in past week

**7+ = BUY signal**
**8-9 = HIGH CONVICTION**
**10 = RARE, but maximum allocation**

## Position Sizing

- **$300/day budget** (5-7 stocks, ~$50-60 each)
- **Max 10% of portfolio per position** (when we scale up)
- **Diversify across 3-5 plays** (don't YOLO one ticker)

## Risk Management

- **15% stop-loss** (give room for volatility on multi-week holds)
- **Partial profit taking:**
  - Sell 30% at +40% (lock in gains)
  - Sell 30% at +100% (double your money)
  - Hold 40% for moon shots (+200-300%)
- **Exit if thesis breaks:**
  - Catalyst fails or gets delayed
  - Fundamentals deteriorate
  - Technical breakdown (breaks support)
  - Insider selling spike

## Hold Time

- **Target:** 2-6 weeks
- **Extend if:** Thesis still valid and momentum building
- **Exit early if:** 
  - Thesis invalidated
  - -15% hit
  - Better opportunity found (rebalance)

## What I'm Looking For (Pattern from June-July winners)

🔥 **EXPLOSIVE SETUP:**
- **Small cap in hot theme** (like VIGL in biotech, CRWV in AI)
- **Catalyst within 2-4 weeks** (earnings, FDA, product launch)
- **Building momentum, not blown out** (early in the move)
- **Technical breakout starting** (volume increasing, consolidation ending)
- **Smart money accumulating** (insider buying, institutional interest)
- **Multiple confirmation signals** (not just Reddit hype)

**Example (VIGL pattern):**
- Biotech with FDA catalyst coming
- Low float = squeeze potential
- Insiders buying
- Social discussion building
- Technical consolidation breaking
- → Result: +324%

❌ **AVOID:**
- No clear catalyst within 4 weeks
- Already ran 100%+ in past week (late)
- Negative earnings surprise
- Dilution announced
- Sector rotation away from theme

## Learning Loop

After every trade:
1. **Log outcome** - Win/loss, % gain/loss, hold time
2. **Thesis validation** - Did the social signal play out?
3. **What worked** - Which data source was most accurate?
4. **What failed** - Did I miss a red flag?
5. **Adjust scoring** - Weight successful patterns higher

## Success Metrics (Based on June-July Benchmark)

- **Win rate:** 80-90% (14/15 was the standard)
- **Avg gain:** +60-80% per winner (some will be +100-300%)
- **Avg loss:** -15% per loser (respect the stop)
- **Hold time:** 2-6 weeks average
- **Monthly target:** +40-60% portfolio growth
- **Daily allocation:** $300 (scale up if we hit 3 consecutive winning weeks)

## Pattern Learning

After every exit (win or loss):
1. **Score accuracy check** - Did the 10-factor score predict the outcome?
2. **What signal mattered most?** - Was it the catalyst? The social? The technical?
3. **Timing** - Entry too early/late?
4. **Adjust scoring weights** - Increase weight on signals that predicted winners

**Remember:** Quality > quantity. Better to hold 5 great setups than 20 mediocre ones.
