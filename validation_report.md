## Detailed Validation Results

### 1. Overall System Health Analysis ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE

**Component Status:**
```
✅ Core API Health: Healthy (all dependencies connected)
✅ Redis Connectivity: Healthy 
✅ Database Connectivity: Healthy
✅ Polygon API: Healthy
✅ External Dependencies: Healthy
❌ Discovery Pipeline: COMPLETE FAILURE
❌ Worker Processing: COMPLETE FAILURE
❌ Data Generation: COMPLETE FAILURE
```

**Critical Findings:**
- **API Facade Working**: `/health` returns healthy status, masking underlying issues
- **Worker Service**: Completely offline with no job processing for extended period
- **Queue Buildup**: 349 jobs accumulated with 0% processing rate
- **Cache Dependency**: System completely dependent on emergency cache data

### 2. Discovery Pipeline Integrity ❌ COMPLETE SYSTEM BREAKDOWN

**Pipeline Status Analysis:**
```
Universe Loading    → ❌ NOT EXECUTING (no worker processing)
Feature Extraction  → ❌ NOT EXECUTING (no worker processing) 
Scoring System      → ❌ NOT EXECUTING (no worker processing)
Cache Population    → ❌ NOT EXECUTING (using emergency data only)
UI Data Delivery    → 🟡 EMERGENCY MODE (demo data only)
```

**Worker Service Investigation:**
- **Queue Status**: 349 pending jobs, 0 failed jobs, 0 processing rate
- **Service State**: Worker service appears completely offline
- **Error Pattern**: UTF-8 decoding errors suggest corrupted Redis data
- **Recovery Attempts**: Multiple triggers added to queue without processing

**Data Quality Assessment:**
```
Current Cache Data: EMERGENCY DEMO DATA ONLY
Real Market Data: UNAVAILABLE (last successful run unknown)
Discovery Coverage: 0% (no actual stock scanning occurring)
Scoring Accuracy: UNMEASURABLE (no scoring pipeline execution)
```

### 3. Scoring Pipeline Validation ❌ COMPLETE FAILURE

**Strategy Testing Results:**
- **Legacy_v0 Strategy**: UNTESTABLE (worker offline)
- **Hybrid_v1 Strategy**: UNTESTABLE (worker offline)
- **Strategy Switching**: NON-FUNCTIONAL (no processing capability)
- **Calibration System**: UNTESTABLE (no execution environment)

**Configuration Analysis:**
- **Active Config**: `/calibration/active.json` properly configured with hybrid_v1
- **Strategy Resolution**: Configuration appears correct but untestable
- **Weight Distribution**: Balanced default preset (35% volume, 25% squeeze, 20% catalyst)
- **Execution Reality**: Zero execution capability renders configuration meaningless

### 4. Data Consistency Analysis ❌ COMPLETE BREAKDOWN

**Redis Data Status:**
```
Discovery Cache Key: amc:discovery:candidates:v2
Status: EMERGENCY DATA (not real market data)
Age: 3+ minutes (beyond freshness threshold)
Content: Single "DEMO" symbol with synthetic data
Real Market Coverage: 0%
```

**API Response Consistency:**
```
/discovery/candidates → Returns emergency demo data only
/discovery/health → Misleading "healthy" status with 349 stuck jobs
/discovery/cache/peek → Shows emergency cache, not real data
Queue Status → 349 jobs stuck, 0% processing rate
```

**UI Impact Assessment:**
- **Frontend Display**: Shows 1 demo candidate instead of 20-50 real opportunities  
- **User Experience**: Completely broken - no actionable trading information
- **Data Freshness**: Displaying synthetic data, not real market conditions
- **Trading Decisions**: Impossible - no real market analysis available

### 5. End-to-End Workflow Validation ❌ COMPLETE BREAKDOWN

**Workflow Status:**
```
Data Ingestion    → ❌ NOT OCCURRING (no worker processing)
Market Scanning   → ❌ NOT OCCURRING (no execution capability)
Stock Filtering   → ❌ NOT OCCURRING (no pipeline execution)
Scoring Analysis  → ❌ NOT OCCURRING (no scoring engine running)
Cache Population  → ❌ NOT OCCURRING (using emergency fallback only)
API Delivery      → 🟡 EMERGENCY MODE (synthetic data delivery)
Frontend Display  → 🟡 EMERGENCY MODE (misleading user with demo data)
```

**Critical Path Analysis:**
1. **Job Trigger**: ✅ Jobs successfully queued (349 accumulated)
2. **Worker Pickup**: ❌ COMPLETE FAILURE - no job processing
3. **Data Processing**: ❌ CANNOT EXECUTE - no worker capability
4. **Result Caching**: ❌ NOT HAPPENING - emergency cache only
5. **API Response**: 🟡 MASKING FAILURE - returns synthetic data

### 6. Configuration and Calibration Accuracy ❌ UNTESTABLE

**Calibration File Status:**
- **File Location**: `/calibration/active.json` ✅ EXISTS
- **Format Validation**: ✅ VALID JSON STRUCTURE
- **Strategy Configuration**: hybrid_v1 with balanced_default preset
- **Threshold Settings**: Properly configured for production
- **Execution Capability**: ❌ UNTESTABLE - no execution environment

**Strategy Resolution Analysis:**
- **Environment Strategy**: Not detected (worker offline)
- **Default Strategy**: hybrid_v1 configured correctly
- **Preset System**: balanced_default active with proper weight distribution
- **Reality Check**: ❌ Configuration meaningless without execution capability
